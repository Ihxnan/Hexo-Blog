# Unit 5 Stress: Friend or Foe?

Is Stress a Friend or Foe?
 
Good [morning/afternoon], everyone!
 
Let me ask you: Have you ever felt your heart race before a big exam, or pushed harder to finish a project because of a deadline? That’s stress—but not the bad kind.
 
Stress is like a double-edged sword. Short-term stress, called eustress, is our “friend.” It sharpens our focus before a speech, fuels us to meet a goal, and even helps us react fast in emergencies. Without it, we might lack motivation to grow.
 
But when stress sticks around—like constant work pressure or endless worries—it becomes our “foe.” Chronic stress drains our energy, messes with our sleep, and hurts our health.
 
So the key isn’t to avoid stress, but to tell them apart. Embrace the small, short stress that pushes you forward, and let go of the long, heavy kind that holds you back.
 
After all, stress is what we make of it. Thank you!
